Please use the appropriate type of graphs we learned to visualize these two pairs of variables. Briefly describe the graph you plot, and answer: Does the graph we create from the data support the hypothesis?\n\n\n\n(1) Hypothesis#1: The more years of education (edu) a person completed, the higher income (income_10) they earn. (7.5%)\nAnswer: edu is a variable with only four values. We can treat it as an ordinal categorical variable. Income has 10 values, and we can treat it as either a continuous or an ordinal categorical variable. In this case, we have several options: a stacked bar or a groupped bar.\n\n#don't forget to remove NAs (if not, -2%)\nedu_income&lt;-ESS_Polity|&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(income_10))|&gt; #remove na in income\n  subset(!is.na(edu))|&gt; #remove na in edu\n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(income_10), fill = as.factor(edu))) + \n    geom_bar()\n\nedu_income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see as in the higher income group, the proportion of highest education level (4) increases. This is more obvious if we do a stacked percentage bar plot.\n\nedu_income&lt;-ESS_Polity|&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(income_10))|&gt; #remove na in income\n  subset(!is.na(edu))|&gt; #remove na in edu\n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(income_10), fill = as.factor(edu))) + \n    geom_bar(position=\"fill\")\n\nedu_income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also do a boxplot of income grouped (since income has 10 values, we can treat it as a continous variable) by education level:\n\nedu_income&lt;-ESS_Polity|&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(income_10))|&gt; #remove na in income\n  subset(!is.na(edu))|&gt; \n  ggplot(aes (x = as.factor(edu), y = income_10)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"slateblue\", alpha=0.2) \n\nedu_income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, scatter plots will look very strange and it is hard to estimate the pattern of variables with less than 10 values.\n\nedu_income&lt;-ESS_Polity|&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(income_10))|&gt; #remove na in income\n  subset(!is.na(edu))|&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(income_10), y = as.factor(edu))) + \n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()\n\nedu_income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in conclusion, this hypothesis is supportive.\n(2) Hypothesis#2: There is a gender disparity (male) in voting behavior (vote). (Either men are more likely to vote, or women are more likely to vote). (7.5%)\nAnswer: both gender and vote are binary variables. So our option is either bar plots or .\n\nmale_vote&lt;-ESS_Polity|&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(male))|&gt; #remove na in income\n  subset(!is.na(vote))|&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(male), fill = as.factor(vote))) + \n    geom_bar(position=\"fill\")\n\nmale_vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm, the average turnouts of male voters and female voters are very similar. It does seem that gender determines people’s voting decisions. In fact, if you use group_by and summarise(), you will find that one is 0.767 (female), and another is 0.759 (male). In conclusion, the second hypothesis does seem to be valid.\n\nESS_Polity|&gt;\n  group_by(male)|&gt;\n  subset(!is.na(male))|&gt; #remove na in income\n  subset(!is.na(vote))|&gt;\n  summarise(mean(vote))"
